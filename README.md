### User stories

- As a user, I would like to be able to see when the restaurant is open, place a call, or get a reservation all from the home page, because it's convenient.
- As a user, I need to see a visual representation of the restaurant, so I know what to expect.
- As a user, I would like to be able to submit a form to book a private event, so I can schedule my party.
- As a user, I would like to be able to submit a form to contact the restaurant, so I can leave feedback.
- As a user, I would like to be able to link to the social accounts, so I can engage with the business across multiple platforms.
- As a user, in the footer I would like to see who designed this website, so that I can hire the developers.
- As an admin user, I need to be able to log into an admin dashboard to update our menu/hours or post/remove menu items, so I can reflect the seasonal changes of the restaurant.
